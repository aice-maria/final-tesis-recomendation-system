# final-tesis-recomendation-system
Design a block for Moodle that recommends educational resources to students based on their emotions.
Specific objectives:
- Study current trends on technologies that support the implementation of Recommender Systems based on Collaborative Filtering.
- Establish the computer resources (languagesand libraries) that must be used in the implementation of a system for recommending educational resources.
- Carry out the design of a recommendation system for educational resources, taking into consideration the emotions of the student when interacting with them.

Abstract
Within Virtual Learning Environments (EVA), the Moodle platform stands out for being one of the
most used worldwide and one of the most complete. The Central University "Marta Abreu" of Las
Villas (UCLV) is part of the community that benefits and supports the growth of Moodle. A shortcoming of the online learning environment is that it does not have facilities that allow recognizing the
emotional state of students in their interaction with study materials and course activities. This work
presents the design of a block for Moodle that allows students to suggest educational resources that
adjust to their state of mind and the particular educational needs of each one. This block is based on
the Emotions block already implemented in the UCLV from which the emotions of the students are
obtained; tell yourselves joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and fear; in a course and time established by the teacher. It is justified, how the collaborative filtering algorithm provided by the Apache
Spark MlLib library is capable of accurately suggesting materials.
Abstract Keywords: emotion recognition, collaborative filtering, recommendation systems, Moodle.
